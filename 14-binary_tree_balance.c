 * Explanation:
 * - The binary_tree_height function is reused from the previous
 * implementation.
 * - The binary_tree_balance function calculates the balance
 * factor of a binary tree.
 * - If the tree is NULL, the balance factor is considered 0.
 * - Otherwise, it calculates the height of the left and right
 * subtrees and subtracts the right height from the left height
 * to get the balance factor.
