/**
* binary_tree_is_complete - Checks if a binary tree is complete

*
* Return: 1 if the binary tree is complete, otherwise 0
*
* Explanation:
* - The binary_tree_is_complete function serves as a wrapper function
* to initiate the check for completeness.
* - It checks if the input tree is NULL and returns 0 if so,
* as an empty tree cannot be considered complete.
* - The binary_tree_is_complete_util function is a recursive utility
* function that traverses the tree in a depth-first manner while
* keeping track of the index of each node.
* - At each node, it checks if the index of the node is less than the
* total number of nodes in the tree.
* - If the index exceeds the total number of nodes, it indicates that
* there is a gap in the tree, and thus the tree is not complete.
* - The function returns 1 if the tree is complete, meaning it has
* no gaps and all levels except possibly the last level are filled,
* and 0 otherwise.
